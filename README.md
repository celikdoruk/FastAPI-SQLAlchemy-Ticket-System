# 🚀 FastAPI + SQLAlchemy Demo Application

A small but clean FastAPI project I made whilst learning web development and object relational mapping concepts, demonstrating a layered architecture:

- 📌 **Routers/Endpoints** (FastAPI)  
- 🧠 **Services** (business logic)  
- 🗄️ **Repositories** (data access / CRUD)  
- 🧱 **SQLAlchemy ORM models** (with a many-to-many between customers and shows, and a many-to-one from shows to an *avanue*)  

The code intentionally keeps things straightforward while still showing good patterns (generic repository, service layer, dependency injection for DB sessions).

## 🛠️ Tech stack
-  **FastAPI** for the web API  
-  **SQLAlchemy 2.x** ORM  
-  **Pydantic v2** for request/response models  
-  **Uvicorn** as the ASGI server  
-  **python-dotenv** for environment variables
